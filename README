Applicable will be a cross-platform framework for mobile applications.

We aim to create abstractions for all common services on the phones. This will include, GPS, Compass, Database, Web services, Camera, and so on.

The plan is to support iOS devices via MonoTouch, Android devices via MonoDroid and WP7 devices via Silverlight. Maybe we will add other platforms later. :-)
